  Hi, my name's Hamza and I'm a computer science graduate from Queen Mary University of London with a 1st class.
  
  As a highly adaptable and competent software engineer, I am proficient in Python, Java, and frontend languages and frameworks (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) with varying experiences in MongoDb, Django, MySQL, and C#.
  
  I have a keen interest in software engineering and I'm enthused by the prospect of becoming a part of such a dynamic and stimulating field. I am confident the skills and determination that have brought me success in the past would stand me in good stead for the exciting challenges ahead.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
